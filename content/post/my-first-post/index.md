This is my first post on my new website! I've always been hesitant to make a
personal website -- it has always felt a bit self-centered -- but I've decided
that for now, the pros outweigh the cons.

I plan on using this website as a portfolio and record of my work, likely in
data analysis but also in any other areas relevant to my experience and goals.
Perhaps as time passes, I'll start jotting notes and thoughts down here as well
(no promises). I don't plan on posting too regularly here, and I can't promise
the website will always be as up-to-date as I wish it were. (I have aspirations,
but I have to be realistic, too.)

That's it for now! 'Till next time :-)
