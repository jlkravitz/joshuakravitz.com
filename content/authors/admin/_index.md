I'm a data enthusiast looking to make a difference.

Recently, I finished working as the Data Director for Sri Kulkarni's
congressional campaign in TX-22. In June 2020, I graduated from Stanford
University with a B.S. in computer science (focus: systems and AI) and M.S. in
statistics (focus: causal inference). 

While I wasn't researching new methods for estimating causal effects at
Stanford, I oversaw the student leadership team for Camp Kesem at Stanford.

In my free time, I watch TV, read, play jazz piano, bake sourdough, and
improvise. To me, improvisation is more than a fun hobby -- it's a way of life.
My favorite improv maxims are "Say Yes," "Follow the Fear," and "Mistakes are
Gifts."
