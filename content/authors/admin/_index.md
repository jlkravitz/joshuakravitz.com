I recently graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in computer systems
(focus: systems and AI) and M.S. in statistics (focus: causal inference).  I am
actively seeking a role in progressive analytics for the 2020 election cycle.

I have a wide array of professional interests, including politics, healthcare,
and experimental design. I am passionate about our democracy and hope to keep
it alive through work on an important campaign or in an organization working to
increase voter participation, fight gerrymandering, have fair elections, and
more. I believe that with a strong democracy, substantive positive change is
more likely to follow.

While I wasn't researching new methods for estimating causal effects at
Stanford, I oversaw the student leadership team for Camp Kesem at Stanford. As
a student director, I gained executive, managerial and administrative
experience, working in areas including (but not limited to): counselor
recruitment and training, marketing and alumni engagement,
fundraiser event planning, and camper recruitment and community engagement.

In my free time, I watch TV, read, play jazz piano, bake sourdough, and
improvise. To me, improvisation is more than a fun hobby -- it's a way of life.
My favorite improv maxims are "Say Yes," "Follow the Fear," and "Mistakes are
Gifts."
