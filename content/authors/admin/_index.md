I am a Stanford graduate student pursuing a degree in statistics, with interests in politics, healthcare and climate change. I am passionate about our democracy, and hope to keep it alive through work on important campaigns and in organizations fighting gerrymandering, for fair elections, and more. I believe that with a strong democracy, substantive, positive change is more likely to follow.

I graduated from Stanford in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science and am pursuing a master's degree in Statistics. While I wasn't researching new methods for estimating causal effects, I oversaw the student leadership team for Camp Kesem at Stanford. As a student director, I gained executive, managerial and administrative experience, working in areas including (but not limited to): marketing and alumni engagement, overseeing the planning and execution of our largest annual fundraiser (raising over $25,000), communicating to our constituents a mid-year change in leadership, and advertising our services on-the-ground to the local community.

In my free time, I watch TV, read, play jazz piano, and improvise. I love learning new things and hope to soon become a better cook, wheel-throw my own pottery, and improve my skills in basketball (my lay-up needs work).
