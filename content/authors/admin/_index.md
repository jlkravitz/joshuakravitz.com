I'm a data enthusiast looking to make a difference.

Now, I lead technology modernization efforts on the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations.
Before that, through [TechCongress](https://techcongress.io), I was a Technology Policy Fellow on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
After graduating in June 2020 from Stanford
University with a B.S. in computer science (focus: systems and AI) and M.S. in
statistics (focus: causal inference), I dove into the world of political campaigns: I was Deputy Data Director on Jon Ossoff's
[campaign for U.S. Senate](https://electjon.com) and Data Director on Sri Kulkarni's
[congressional campaign](https://sri2020.com). 

While I wasn't researching new methods for estimating causal effects at
Stanford, I oversaw the student leadership team for [Camp Kesem at Stanford](https://campkesemstanford.org).

In my free time, I watch TV, read, play jazz piano, bake sourdough, and
[improvise](https://www.improvwisdom.com/). To me, improvisation is more than a fun hobby -- it's a way of life.
My favorite improv maxims are "Say Yes," "Follow the Fear," and "Mistakes are
Gifts."
